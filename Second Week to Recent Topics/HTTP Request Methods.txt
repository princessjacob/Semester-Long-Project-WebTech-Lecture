HTTP REQUEST METHODS
- The HTTP REQUEST METHODS are commonly used to specify a certain action for a given resource. While commonly nouns, they are referred to as HTTP verbs. The most commonly used methods are the POST, GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE, which corresponds with CRUD(create, read, update and delete). 

STANDARD METHODS

1. GET - Requests data from a specified resource. The method itself is not going to affect the resource taken by the data.

2. POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. This often causes a change in state or side effects on the server.

3. HEAD - Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body.

4. PUT - Uploads a representation of the specified URI. It replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

5. DELETE - Deletes the specified resource and causes a change on the resource as a result.

6. OPTIONS - Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports. This is used to describe communication options for the target resource.

7. CONNECT - Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel.

8. PATCH - This is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

9. TRACE - Requests a loopback of the request message and then requests the server to echo back to the client the received request message. TRACE is also typically used for testing/diagnostics of the request/response chain

* Chunk Encoding - message is sent by chunks and measured by its length.
* content-length - identifies how large the file is; deals with what type the fata's file is

EXTEND METHODS
i.e. WebDav (World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)

What is WebDAV?
- This is an IETF standard for collaborative authoring in the Web. This is commonly used for users located remotely from each other in the Internet that needs a tool for collaborative editing and file management. 

WebDav methods
1. PROPFIND – This is used to retrieve properties, stored as XML, from a web resource. It is also overloaded to allow one to retrieve the collection structure (also known as directory hierarchy) of a remote system.
2. PROPPATCH – This is used to change and delete multiple properties on a resource in a single atomic act.
3. MKCOL – This is used to create collections (a.k.a. a directory).
4. COPY – This is used to copy a resource from one URI to another.
5. MOVE – This is used to move a resource from one URI to another.
6. LOCK – This is used to put a lock on a resource. WebDAV supports both shared and exclusive locks.
7. UNLOCK – This is used to remove a lock from a resource.

DAV SPECIFICATIONS

2. RFC 3253
3. RFC 5323
4. WebDAV Bindings
5. RFC 4437
6. RFC 3648
7. RFC 3744
8. Advanced ATL Extensions to WebDAV
9. RFC 4122

OTHER METHODS
1. SAFE METHODS - these methods doesn't affect the resource. The only change to do is the log of the resource.
i.e. GET, HEAD, TRACE and OPTIONS

2. IDEMPOTENT METHODS - The repeated execution of the methods should result to the same effect.
i.e. GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE

3. CACHEABLE METHODS - The response to requests is going to a cacheable
- cache: This is where you can store something or local storage.
