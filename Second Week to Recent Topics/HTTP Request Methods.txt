HTTP REQUEST METHODS

STANDARD METHODS

1. GET - Requests data from a specified resource. The method itself is not going to affect the resource taken by the data.

2. POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. This often causes a change in state or side effects on the server.

3. HEAD - Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body.

4. PUT - Uploads a representation of the specified URI. It replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

5. DELETE - Deletes the specified resource and causes a change on the resource as a result.

6. OPTIONS - Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports. This is used to describe communication options for the target resource.

7. CONNECT - Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel.

8. PATCH - This is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

9. TRACE - Requests a loopback of the request message and then requests the server to echo back to the client the received request message. TRACE is also typically used for testing/diagnostics of the request/response chain

* Chunk Encoding - message is sent by chunks and measured by its length.
* content-length - identifies how large the file is; deals with what type the fata's file is

EXTEND METHODS
i.e. WebDav (World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)

What is WebDAV?
- This is an IETF standard for collaborative authoring in the Web. This is commonly used for users located remotely from each other in the Internet that needs a tool for collaborative editing and file management. 

WebDav methods
1. PROPFIND – This is used to retrieve properties, stored as XML, from a web resource. It is also overloaded to allow one to retrieve the collection structure (also known as directory hierarchy) of a remote system.
2. PROPPATCH – This is used to change and delete multiple properties on a resource in a single atomic act.
3. MKCOL – This is used to create collections (a.k.a. a directory).
4. COPY – This is used to copy a resource from one URI to another.
5. MOVE – This is used to move a resource from one URI to another.
6. LOCK – This is used to put a lock on a resource. WebDAV supports both shared and exclusive locks.
7. UNLOCK – This is used to remove a lock from a resource.

6. RFC 3648
7. RFC 3744
8. Advanced ATL Extensions to WebDAV
9. RFC 4122

OTHER METHODS
1. SAFE METHODS - these methods doesn't affect the resource. The only change to do is the log of the resource.
i.e. GET, HEAD, TRACE and OPTIONS

2. IDEMPOTENT METHODS - The repeated execution of the methods should result to the same effect.
i.e. GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE

3. CACHEABLE METHODS - The response to requests is going to a cacheable
- cache: This is where you can store something or local storage.
