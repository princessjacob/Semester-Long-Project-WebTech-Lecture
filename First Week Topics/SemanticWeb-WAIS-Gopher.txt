Semantic Web
Semantic web was an idea by Tim Berners-Lee. It is also a form of the World Wide Web in which data or information that are in web pages is tagged and structured so it can be directly read by computers. Semantic web is mostly focused for computers so it can perform tasks without an operator.

WAIS
WAIS which is pronounced as “ways” or Wide Area Information Servers was developed by Thinking Machines Inc. in 1988. It uses indexing or collecting information from different information servers and searching document indexes. It has it’s  own Internet protocol. WAIS also has four parts, the client, server, database and the protocol. It is based as search model of information rather than browsing. When a user tries to look for an information and enters a search statement for a selected database then the client gets access to all servers on where the database is distributed. It results meaning  of each text that matches the search that has been made then the user can get the full text.
