Client Side Scripting

Allows program (i.e. scripts) to be downloaded from a web server and executed in the
client environment (e.g. browser)

Common client-side scripting technologies
  -JavaScript
	-It was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich and in 1997 it became an ECMA standard.
It is designed for creating network-centric applications.
  -ECMAScript 
	-European Computer Manufacturer's Association. 
	-It is a subset of JavaScript. 
	-It is a Standard for a scripting languages
  -Jscript
	-Microsoft dialect of the ECMAScript scripting language specification.
The modern scripting language with a wide variety of applications is the 
JScript 10.0.
  -Java Applets
	-It is a small application which is written in Java or another programming
language.
  -ActiveX Controls
	-It is a component program object that can be re-used by many application
programs within a computer or among computers in a network.
  -Flash Animations
	-It is also called as Flash cartoon. It is an animated film that is created 
with the Adobe Flash.
  -Microsoft Silverlight 
	-Integrates multimedia,graphics,animations, and interactivity into a single 
run-time environment.
  -Adobe Integrated Runtime (Adobe AIR)
	-It is a cross-operating system runtime
	-It lets the developers combine HTML,JavaScript,Adobe Flash and Flex 
technologies, and ActionScript

Common uses:
  -Dynamic (X)HTML
      -Page embelishments, visual "effects", content generation and manipulation,
user interaction, document and page navigation
  -Client-side form data validation
	-Checking a web form and making sure all the data are complete and correct 
before sending off to the server.

Common issues:
  -Browser support
      -No scripting support
      -Scripting disabled
      -Plugin availability
  -Version incompatibilities, non-standard implementations
  -Capabilities restrictions
      -Scripting languages are not for general-purpose programming
      -E.g. Javascript is restricted by the sandbox execution model and the same origin
policy
  -Security risks
      -Browser implementation defects (e.g. buffer overflows)
      -E.g. Javascript, cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery
(XSRF) issues
      -Malicious ActiveX controls
