            CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is used to control the design of a web page. It is used in formatting the style or design of the elements/ attributes that has been implemented in the html or it simply controls on how the content of the HTML document will be presented. In other words, CSS instructs the content of a webpage on how should it look. It is the presentation aspects of structural makup documents like HTML.
        </p>
        <h3>MAIN CONCEPTS</h3>
        <p>
            It was developed by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. CSS works  with different markup languages popularly with HTML, it is also used in other markup languages like XML and XHTML. CSS files can be created on lots of text editors such as Notepad++, Sublime Text and etc. CSS uses the attributes "class", "id" to manipulate the styles.<br>
            Example of CSS below:
        </p>
        <p>
            body {
            font-family: Times New Roman;
            color: red;
            font-size: 16px;
            }
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS was made a specification by the W3C and today allows web developers to alter the layout and appearance of their web pages. W3m or the World Wide Web Consortium was the one who standardized CSS, it allows web developers to change the layout  or how their web page looks. <br>
            Other concepts: CSS is managed by W3C - Recommendations are created when something is old enough <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Style Sheets:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>1. Embedded style sheets</li>
                <p>
                    These are style sheets that are part of an HTML document, it is more useful when used in single web  pages.
                </p>
                <li>2. External style sheets</li>
                <p>
                    The content of  external style sheet looks the same with embedded but they are not included in the HTML page, they are placed in a separate file with an extension file of ".css".
                </p>
                <li>3. Inline style sheets</li>
                <p>
                    This style sheet is the same with embedded because they are placed inside the HTML document. It is easier to edit styles while using inline style because you can easily edit your style within the document.
                </p>
            <ol>
        </p>

        <h3>CSS 1</h3>
       <p>It has the basic structure that still uses today such as fonts, backgrounds,
text alignment, spacing, margins. This is the first version of CSS and it was
introduced in December 17, 1996. It was recommended by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).
CSS 1 is no longer maintained by the W3C</p>
       <h3>CSS 2</h3>
       <p>It has more features such as more powerful selectors, bidirectional text,
and targeting media types. CSS 2 was published in 1998. The specification
was developed by W3C and the properties that was added allowed CSS to be used
for page layout. Same with CSS 1, CSS 2 is no longer maintained by the W3C.</p>
       <h3>CSS 2.1</h3>
       <p>CSS 2.1 has all the specifications of CSS 1. It was published in 2011 and the
co-editor of CSS 2.1 specification was Ian Hickson. It has several properties

</p>
       <h3>CSS 3</h3>
       <p>It is divided into modules (e.g. Selectors, Box Model, Backgrounds and Borders,
