			<p><b>WAIS </b><br/>WAIS which is pronounced as “ways” or Wide Area Information Servers was developed by Thinking Machines Inc. in 1988. It uses indexing or collecting information from different information servers and searching document indexes. It has it’s own Internet protocol. WAIS also has four parts, the client, server, database and the protocol. It is based as search model of information rather than browsing. When a user tries to look for an information and enters a search statement for a selected database then the client gets access to all servers on where the database is distributed. It results meaning of each text that matches the search that has been made then the user can get the full text.

		<div id = "SemanticWeb">
			<p><b>SEMANTIC WEB </b><br/>Semantic web was an idea by Tim Berners-Lee. It is also a form of the World Wide Web in which data or information that are in web pages is tagged and structured so it can be directly read by computers. Semantic web is mostly focused for computers so it can perform tasks without an operator.

			<p><b>GOPHER </b><br/>It is a protocol that has an ability to view and extract documents from the Web that are stored on remote web servers. It is design to access a Web server or database with the use of internet. It was discussed in RFC 1436

		<div id = "UseNet">
			<p>
				A collection of newsgroups where the users can post messages. The following messages are then stored in different servers. These messages are only available for a certain amount of time. It can be likened to an internet forum post with a messaging system with a time limit and a lot of servers instead of just one. (usenet.org. 2017)	
			</p>	
			<p>
				Newsreaders : Typically used applications for people to read and reply in newsgroups.
			</p>
			<p>
				Retention Time -  the time allotted for the messages before they are not considered available anymore
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, downloading from usenet is also allowed, which works similar as posting messages. Only a short binary file will be posted in binary newsgroups also called binaries. Binaries are recognized by the names of their newsgroups. (usenet.org. 2017). In order to download things, post messages, reply to messages, there is a need for a usenet reader which can be downloaded in their site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Usenet popularized the terms, FAQ, flame and spam

			<p><b>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL (TCP/IP) </b><br/>
			TCP/IP or the TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL, is the protocol used over the internet in order for the computers to communicate to each other. It is also used in a private network as a communication protocol.
			</p>
			<p>
			TCP/IP is a consists of two-layer program. First, transmission control protocol which manages and assembles a file into packets in which it is transmitted on the internet and it is received by the TCP layer and reassembles it on the original form of the message. Second, is the internet protocol which holds the address part of every packet in order for the packet to get in the correct destination.

		<div id = "Network">
			<p><b>COMPUTER NETWORK </b><br/>
			Computer network or network is well-defined as a group or collection of computer systems that are linked together. It is also called the data network. It is the series of nodes, physical device, that is interconnected by communication paths in order to transmit, receive and exchange data voice and video traffic.
			</p>
			<p>
			Reference:
			Beal, V. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/N/network.html
			</p>
			<p>
			There are some network characteristics:
			a. TOPOLOGY – it is the geometric sequence of the computer system.
			b. PROTOCOL - it is the set or rules and signals in which the computers on a network can communicate.
			c. ARCHITECTURE - can be broadly classified as peer-to-peer or client/server architecture.

			<p><b>WIRED & WIRELESS INTERCONNECTION TECHNOLOGY</b><br/>
			Wired Interconnection Technology is a way to transmit data which uses wires to communicate between computers. It is said to be the most stable in all the types of communication services.
			Wireless Interconnection Technology is the way to transfer information within devices/ points that are not connected by any conductor. Information is transferred trough radio waves.

			<p><b>DEVICE DRIVERS</b><br/>
			Device Driver is a program which controls a specific type of device and is attached to the computer. It is a bit of software which tells the (OS) Operating System in what way to communicate with the hardware. It is said to be a small program which allows a computer and a device to connect with one another. Its purpose is to hold the requests which is made by the kernel with regard to a specific type of devices. It resides within the Digital UNIX kernel.
			Block Device Drivers - supports a file system which is called as the block devices.
			Character Device Drivers - it performs the Input/output in the form of byte stream.
			Memory Mapped Devices - it is the device driver which has direct access to the device memory.
