				<h1>SEMANTIC WEB </h1>
				<p>
					Semantic web was an idea by Tim Berners-Lee. It is also a form of the World Wide Web in which data or information that are in web pages is tagged and structured so it can be directly read by computers. Semantic web is mostly focused for computers so it can perform tasks without an operator.
