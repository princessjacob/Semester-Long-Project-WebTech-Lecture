				<h1>USENET</h1>
				<p>
					A collection of newsgroups where the users can post messages. The following messages are then stored in different servers. These messages are only available for a certain amount of time. It can be likened to an internet forum post with a messaging system with a time limit and a lot of servers instead of just one. (usenet.org. 2017)	
				</p>	

				<p>
					Newsreaders : Typically used applications for people to read and reply in newsgroups.
				</p>

				<p>
					Retention Time -  the time allotted for the messages before they are not considered available anymore
				</p>

				<p>
					Also, downloading from usenet is also allowed, which works similar as posting messages. Only a short binary file will be posted in binary newsgroups also called binaries. Binaries are recognized by the names of their newsgroups. (usenet.org. 2017). In order to download things, post messages, reply to messages, there is a need for a usenet reader which can be downloaded in their site.

					Usenet popularized the terms, FAQ, flame and spam
