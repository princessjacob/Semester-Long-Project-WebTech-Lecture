DOM (Document Object Model)
 * This defines a logical document structure that shows how a document is accessed and manipulated. 
 * It can also be called a programming API for documents because it closely resembles a structure of the document that it models.
 i.e. <p> <img> text </p>

Two Types of Rendering
    The two types of rendering pages are created as standards so that new compliant sites are interpreted differently from legacy ones.

1) Standards - Rendering on browsers is consistent.
    a. Almost Standards Mode - a small number of quirks is implemented
    b. Full Standards Modes - the behavior is described by the HTML and CSS in hopeful terms.
2) Quirks - Each browser renders the page on their own way. i.e. A placing of an image may look different in Firefox and Internet Explorer
