The Boolean object is an object wrapper for a boolean value.

Syntax:
	new Boolean([value])

Parameters:
	value
		-Discretionary. The underlying value of the Boolean object.

Description:
	The value go as the main parameter is changed over to a boolean value, if fundamental. On the off chance that the value is precluded or is 0, - 0, invalid, false, NaN, unclear, or the void string (""), the object has an underlying estimation of false. In the event that the DOM protest document.all is passed as a parameter, the new boolean object likewise has an underlying estimation of false. Every single other value, including any object or the string "false", make a protest with an underlying estimation of true. 

	Try not to confound the primitive Boolean values true and false with the true and false estimations of the Boolean object.


Boolean Instances

Every single Boolean example acquire from Boolean.prototype. Similarly as with all constructors, the model protest manages examples' acquired properties and methods. 


Properties 

Boolean.prototype.constructor 

Gives back the capacity that made an occurrence's model. This is the Boolean capacity as a matter of course. 


Methods 

Boolean.prototype.toSource() 

	Gives back a string containing the wellspring of the Boolean protest; you can utilize this string to make an identical question. Supersedes the Object.prototype.toSource() method. 

Boolean.prototype.toString() 

	Gives back a string of either "true" or "false" contingent on the estimation of the protest. Abrogates the Object.prototype.toString() technique. 

Boolean.prototype.valueOf() 

	Gives back the primitive estimation of the Boolean question. Supersedes the Object.prototype.valueOf() method.

DATE - The Date object has a large number of methods for setting, getting, and manipulating dates. It does not have any properties.The Date object range is -100,000,000 days to 100,000,000 days relative to 01 January, 1970 UTC.

Syntax
	dateObjectName = new Date([parameters])
	new Date();
	new Date(value);
	new Date(dateString);
	new Date(year, month[, date[, hours[, minutes[, second[,milliseconds]]]]]);
Parameters
	today = new Date()
Description
	The JavaScript date is based on a time value that is milliseconds since midnight 01 January, 1970 UTC. A day holds 86,400,000 milliseconds. The JavaScript Date object range is -100,000,000 days to 100,000,000 days relative to 01 January, 1970 UTC.
	

MATH - Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Not a function object.

Description
	nlike the other global objects, Math is not a constructor. All properties and methods of Math are static. You refer to the constant pi as Math.PI and you call the sine function as Math.sin(x), where x is the method's argument. Constants are defined with the full precision of real numbers in JavaScript.


NUMBER - The Number JavaScript object is a wrapper object allowing you to work with numerical values. A Number object is created using the Number() constructor.

Syntax
	new Number(value);
Parameters
	value - The numeric value of the object being created.	
Description
	The primary uses for the Number object are:

If the argument cannot be converted into a number, it returns NaN.
In a non-constructor context (i.e., without the new operator), Number can be used to perform a type conversion.

STRING - The String global object is a constructor for strings, or a sequence of characters.

Syntax
	String(thing)
Parameters
	thing - Anything to be converted to a string.
Description
	Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring() method.


DATE - Composed of two Properties: Constructor and Prototype

Constructors - Specifies the function that creates an object's prototype. Javascript date constructor property returns a reference to the array function that created the instance's prototype. 

Syntax:
	date.constructor 

Example:	
	<script type="text/javascript"> 
		var dt = new Date(); 
		document.write("dt.constructor is : " + dt.constructor); 
	</script> 

    Output:
	dt.constructor is : function Date() { [native code] } 


Prototype - The prototype property allows you to add properties and methods to an object. The prototype property allows you to add properties and methods to any object (Number, Boolean, String, Date, etc.). 
	

Syntax:
	object.prototype.name = value 
Example:
	function book(title, author)
			{
				this.title = title;
				this.author = author;
			}
	
	<script type="text/javascript">
			var myBook = new book("Evolution of JAVA", "Helmsley");
			book.prototype.price=690;
			//myBook.price = 690;
			document.write("Book title is : " + myBook.title + "<br>");
			document.write("Book author is : " + myBook.author + "<br>");
			document.write("Book price is : " + myBook.price + "<br>");
	</script>

    Output:
	Book title is : Evolution of JAVA
	Book author is : Helmsley
	Book price is : 690

Date Objects:
	Methods				Value Range		Description

	dateObj.getDate()		    1-31		Date within the month
	dateobj.setDate()

	dateObj. getDay()		    0-6			Day of the Week
	dateObj. setDay()

	dateObj. getFullYear()		    1970-...		Get the four digit year (yyyy).
	dateObj. setFullYear()					Set the year

	dateObj. getHours()		    0-23		Hour of the day in 24-Hour time
	dateObj. setHours()

	dateObj. getMilliseconds()	    0-999		Milliseconds since the previous full second(NN4+,Mozl+,Ie3+)
	dateObj. setMilliseconds()

	dateObj. getMonth()		    0-11		Month within the year(January=0)
	dateObj. setMonth()

	dateObj.getSeconds()		    0-59		Second within the specified minute

	dateObj. getMinutes()		    0-59		Minute of the specified Hour
	dateObj. setMinutes()

	dateObj.getTime()		    0-â€¦			Milliseconds since 1/1/70 00:00:00 GMT
