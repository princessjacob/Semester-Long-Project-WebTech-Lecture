HTTP (Hypertext transfer protocol)

DEFINITION
	* An application protocol for distributed, collaborative,and hypermedia information systems.
	* HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the 	World Wide Web.
	* Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.
	* Jointly developed by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
	* HTTP is stateless communication protocol, which means that it doesn't take information about clients in between request. 
	* This is based on client-server architecture or a request-response standard, wherein the clients sends an HTTP request to a server and the server replies with a response message.
	* HTTP typically runs on top of TCP/IP using port 80 by default while port 443 for HTTPS.


VERSION HISTORY
HTTP 0.9 One line Protocol 
	* The original HTTP proposal by Tim Berners-Lee was	designed with simplicity in mind as to help with the adoption of his other nascent idea: the World Wide Web.  
	* 1991. Berners-Lee outlined the motivation for the new protocol and listed several high-level design goals: file transfer functionality, ability to request an index search of a hypertext archive, format negotiation, and an ability to refer the client to another server.
HTTP 1: Rapid Growth and Informational RFC 
 	* The period from 1991 to 1995. A new breed of software	known as a "web browser" and the emergence and quick growth of the consumer-oriented public Internet infrastructure. 
	* They	needed a protocol that could serve more than just hypertext documents, provide richer metadata about the request and the response, enable content negotiation, and more. 
	HTTP 1.1: Internet Standard
	* This resolved a lot of the protocol ambiguities found in earlier versions and introduced a number of critical performance optimizations: keepalive connections, chunked encoding transfers, byte-range requests, additional caching mechanisms, transfer encodings, and request pipelining.
	* It also added content, encoding, character set, and even language negotiation, transfer encoding, caching directives, client cookies, plus a dozen other capabilities that can be negotiated on each request.
