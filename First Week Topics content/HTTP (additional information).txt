Fundamentals
HTTP typicaly runs on top of TCP/IP, using TCP port 80 by default (TCP port 443 for 
HTTPS)

HTTP resources are identified using URIs (specifically, HTTP URLs)
  -Scheme (http: or https:)
  -(optional) authentication information
  -Host and (optional) port number
  -Path (resolved to the document root on the server) to the resource
  -(optional) scheme-specific parameters
  -(optional) URL-encoded query
  -(optional) bookmark (or fragment identifier)

HTTP is based on client-server architecture

-Clients, aka User Agents(UA) 
  -web browsers, web crawlers, email clients,other end user tools and applications
-Servers
  -Origin servers, proxy servers, gateways, tunnels

HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol
  -The client sends an HTTP request message to the server
  -The server processes the request and replies with an HHTP response message

HTTP is a stateless communication protocol
  -Servers do not keep information about clients in between requests
  -Web applications effect session tracking using mechanism such as cookies on
URL-encoded session information to keep track of related client requests

HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as cache control, content media
type (MIME) specification, language and character set specification, content/transfer
coding, client-server protocol negotiations, persistent connections, request pipelining,
etc.
