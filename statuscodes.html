<header> HTTP STATUS CODES </header>

<article>

<h1> <b>Informational (1xx)</b> </h1>
<p>1xx stands for 100 up to 102. These three are considered informational status codes. Unlike other status codes, the 1xx series are not a part of the first HTTP version or the HTTP/1.0.
<p>When a status code is informational in nature, it only tells the user or software agent that the request has been obtained. During this time, there is no rejection whatsoever coming from the server. What this means is that the user agent should carry on with the process, which is usually done by completing the remainder of the request. Once the request is complete, the user agent will totally ignore the code or the message it holds.
	<ul>
		<li>100 Continue
			<p>When the server receives the request headers, 100 Continue occurs. In this case, the client is required to proceed in sending the request body. This is true if there is a body that needs to be sent, such as in a POST request. Large request bodies are often rejected by the server due to inappropriate request headers. To resolve this issue, the client must send the following as a header upon the initial request: Expect: 100-continue.
		<li>101 Switching Protocols
			<p>This means that the server understands the request from the client and will comply through switching the protocol. For instance, if HTTP/1.0 is released, the server will change from HTTP/2.0 to HTTP/1.0.
		<li>102 Processing
			<p>This is a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) request. Just like the others in its class, this has several sub-requests that contain file operations. This means that it may take a while to achieve the completion of the request. If the user agent receives this message, it indicates that the server is currently processing the request, but there is unavailable action at the moment.
	</ul>

<h1> <b>Success (2xx)</b> </h1>
<p>This class of status code indicates that the client's request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
	<ul>
		<li>200 OK
			<p>The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request.
		<li>201 Created
			<p>The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in the entity of the response, with the most specific URI for the resource given by a Location header field. The response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code. If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server SHOULD respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.
		<li>202 Accepted
			<p>The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request may or may not eventually be acted upon, as it may be disallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this.
		<li>203 Non Authoritative Information
			<p>The returned metainformation in the entity-header is not the definitive set as available from the origin server, but is gathered from a local or a third-party copy. The set presented MAY be a subset or superset of the original version. For example, including local annotation information about the resource might result in a superset of the metainformation known by the origin server. Use of this response code is not required and is only appropriate when the response would otherwise be 200 (OK).
		<li>204 No Content
			<p>The server has fulfilled the request but there is no new information to send back. If the client is a user agent, it should not change its document view from that which caused the request to be generated. This response is primarily intended to allow input for scripts or other actions to take place without causing a change to the user agent's active document view. The response may include new metainformation in the form of entity headers, which should apply to the document currently in the user agent's active view.
		<li>205 Reset Content
			<p>The server has fulfilled the request and the user agent SHOULD reset the document view which caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place via user input, followed by a clearing of the form in which the input is given so that the user can easily initiate another input action. The response MUST NOT include an entity.
		<li>206 Partial Content
			<p>The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource. The request MUST have included a Range header field indicating the desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range header field to make the request conditional.
	</ul>

<h1> <b>Redirection (3xx)</b></h1>
<p>This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request. The action required MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user.
	<ul>
		<li>300 Multiple Choices
			<p>The requested resource corresponds to any one of a set of representations, each with its own specific location, and agent- driven negotiation information is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred representation and redirect its request to that location.
		<li>301 Moved Permanently
			<p>The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned URIs. Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references to the Request-URI to one or more of the new references returned by the server, where possible. This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.
		<li>302 Found
			<p>The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.
		<li>303 See Other
			<p>The response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method on that resource. This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the originally requested resource. The 303 response MUST NOT be cached, but the response to the second (redirected) request might be cacheable.
		<li>304 Not Modified
			<p>If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD respond with this status code. The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.
		<li>305 Use Proxy
			<p>The requested resource MUST be accessed through the proxy given by the Location field. The Location field gives the URI of the proxy. The recipient is expected to repeat this single request via the proxy. 305 responses MUST only be generated by origin servers.
		<li>306 (Unused)
			<p>The 306 status code was used in a previous version of the specification, is no longer used, and the code is reserved.
		<li>307 Temporary Redirect
			<p>The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.
	</ul>

<h1> <b>Client Error (4xx)</b> </h1>
<p>The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred. These status codes are applicable to any request method.
	<ul>
		<li>400 Bad Request
			<p>The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client should not repeat the request without modifications.
		<li>401 Unauthorized
			<p>The request requires user authentication. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client may repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field . If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user should be presented the entity that was given in the response, since that entity may include relevant diagnostic information.
		<li>402 Payment Required
			<p>This code is reserved for future use.
		<li>403 Forbidden
			<p>The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request should not be repeated. If the request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make public why the request has not been fulfilled, it should describe the reason for the refusal in the entity body. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.
		<li>404 Not Found
			<p>The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.
		<li>405 Method Not Allowed
			<p>The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the resource identified by the Request-URI. The response MUST include an Allow header containing a list of valid methods for the requested resource.
		<li>406 Not Acceptable
			<p>The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.
		<li>407 Proxy Authentication Required
			<p>This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the client MUST first authenticate itself with the proxy.
		<li>408 Request Timeout
			<p>The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at any later time.
		<li>409 Conflict
			<p>The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that may not be possible and is not required.
		<li>410 Gone
			<p>The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be considered permanent. Clients with link editing capabilities SHOULD delete references to the Request-URI after user approval. If the server does not know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) SHOULD be used instead.
		<li>411 Length Required
			<p>The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content- Length. The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length header field containing the length of the message-body in the request message.
		<li>412 Precondition Failed
			<p>The precondition given in one or more of the request-header fields evaluated to false when it was tested on the server. This response code allows the client to place preconditions on the current resource metainformation (header field data) and thus prevent the requested method from being applied to a resource other than the one intended.
		<li>413 Request Entity Too Large
			<p>The server is refusing to process a request because the request entity is larger than the server is willing or able to process. The server MAY close the connection to prevent the client from continuing the request.
		<li>414 Request URI Too Long
			<p>The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
		<li>415 Unsupported Media Type
			<p>he server is refusing to service the request because the entity of the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method.
		<li>416 Request Range Not Satisfiable
			<p>A server SHOULD return a response with this status code if a request included a Range request-header field (section 14.35), and none of the range-specifier values in this field overlap the current extent of the selected resource, and the request did not include an If-Range request-header field.
		<li>417 Expectation Failed
			<p>The expectation given in an Expect request-header field could not be met by this server, or, if the server is a proxy, the server has unambiguous evidence that the request could not be met by the next-hop server.
		<li>426 Upgrade Required
			<p>The client should switch to a different protocol such as TLS/1.0 or WebSockets, specified by the accompanying Upgrade response-header field.
	</ul>

<h1> <b> Server Error (5xx)</b> </h1>
<p>Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the request. If the client has not completed the request when a 5xx code is received, it should immediately cease sending data to the server. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These response codes are applicable to any request method and there are no required header fields.
	<ul>
		<li>500 Internal Server Error
			<p>The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
		<li>501 Not Implemented
			<p>The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. This is the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.
		<li>502 Bad Gateway
			<p>The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.
		<li>503 Service Unavailable
			<p>The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay.
		<li>504 Gateway Timeout
			<p>The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g. HTTP, FTP, LDAP) or some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed to access in attempting to complete the request.
		<li>505 HTTP Version Not Supported
			<p>The server does not support, or refuses to support, the HTTP protocol version that was used in the request message. The server is indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same major version as the client, as described in section 3.1, other than with this error message. The response SHOULD contain an entity describing why that version is not supported and what other protocols are supported by that server.
