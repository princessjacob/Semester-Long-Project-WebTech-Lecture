Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern
	* The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the 	controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-	standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.

	 Model
		o Represents business objects (logic and state)
	 View

	 Controller
