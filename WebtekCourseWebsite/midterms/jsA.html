      <h3>What is ECMAScript?</h3>
      <p> The official name of Javascript. This is a language standardized by ECMA International. This language is also mainly used for the client-side scripting by coders and also used for server side scripting and Node.js services. The file extension that ECMAScript uses is .es.</p>
      <h3>History of ECMAScript</h3>
      <h4>April 27, 1960</h4>
      <p>In Brussels, the European Computer Manufacturers Association or ECMA and a committee was nominated to prepare for the formation of the Association and to draw up by-law and rules.</p>
      <h4>December 1960</h4>
      <p>The headquarters is decided to be moved in Geneva to be near headquarters of the International Standard Organization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission.</p>
      <h4>May 17, 1961</h4>
      <p>The constituent assemply happened as well as the association becoming official with the attendees becoming the official members.</p>
      <h4>1987</h4>
      <p>ECMA became A-liasion member of JTC-1 when TC97 became part of ISO/IEC JTC 1.</p>
      <h4>1994</h4>
      <p>The name of ECMA was changed to Ecma International - European Association for standardizing information and communication systems.</p>
      <h4>June 2011</h4>
      <p>Ecma international celebrated Golden Jubilee while organizing the 101st General Assembly.</p>
      <h4>Since 2013</h4>
      <p>ECMA international regularly grants Awards of appreciation to standardization experts.</p>
      <h3>VERSIONS</h3>
      <p>There are currently 7 editions of ECMAScript -- with an 8th edition coming underway.</p>
      <h4>ECMAScript 1</h4>
      <p>Created on 1997 and by Guy J. Steele. This is the first version of ECMAScript.</p>
      <h4>ECMAScript 2</h4>
      <p>Created on 1998 and by Mike Cowlishaw. This is the second version of ECMAScript and is only composed of editorial changes to fully align it with with an ISO standard.</p>
      <h4>ECMAScript 3</h4>
      <p>Created on 1999 by Mike Cowlishaw. This is the third version of ECMAScript. This version comprised the langauges core functionalities such as regular expressions, better string handling, new control statments, try/catch exceptions, tighter definition of errors and formatting.</p>
      <h4>
ECMAScript 4 (Abandoned)</h4>
      <p>The fourth version due to language complexity underlying on political differences.</p>
      <h4>ECMAScript 5</h4>
      <p>Created on 2009 by Pratap Lakshman and Alen Wirfs-Brock. This version introduced the strict mode, which gives more thorough error checking and avoidance of error-prone constructs. It clarifies ambiguities in the 3rd edition of ECMAScript. It also added getters and setters, JSON library and a more complete reflection on objects.</p>
      <h4>ECMAScript 5.1</h4>
      <p>Created on 2011 by the same authors as ECMAScript 5. It is fully aligned with the third edition and conformed with an ISO international standard.</p>
      <h4>ECMAScript 6</h4>
      <p>Created on 2015 by Allen Wirfs-Brock. This is initially called as ECMAScript 6 or ES6 but have been later renamed as ECMAScript 2015. It is also known as ES Harmony given as it is the first ECMAScript Harmony. This version included classes and modules as well as some new features such as iterators, for/of loops, Python-style generators, and the like. Most features added gave more functionality to ECMAScript.</p>
      <h4>ECMAScript 7</h4>
      <p>Created on 2016 by Brian Terlson. This is the seventh version of ECMAScript. It added functionalities such as exponentation operator and Array.prototype.includes.</p>

      <h3>LEVEL 1</h3>
      <p>It was introduced in 1998 by W3C.
Provided a complete model for an entire HTML or XML document, it
includes to change any portion of the document.
It defines <html> tag as a special element node, called as the document
element. The most common object types of DOM Level 1 are document, element, attr
and text. The DOMImplementation is an object class that provides access to Document creation
methods.</p>
      <h3>LEVEL 2</h3>
      <p>The DOM Level 2 specification contains six different specifications: The DOM2 Core, Views, Events, Style, Traversal and Range, and the DOM2 HTML. Most of the DOM Level 2 is supported in Mozilla.</p>
      <p>The DOM2 Core extends the functionality of the DOM1 Core. It also contains specialized interfaces dedicated to XML. Examples of methods introduced in the DOM2 Core include the famous getElementById, and many namespace-related methods.
Level of support: Very good. See our bugs in the Core specification.</p>
      <p>The DOM2 Views allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content of a representation of a document. The introduced interfaces are AbstractView and DocumentView.
Level of support: Perfect.</p>
      <p>The DOM2 Events gives a generic event system to programs and scripts. It introduces the concepts of event flow, capture, bubbling, and cancellation. Famous methods here include addEventListener and handleEvent. Several interfaces make your life easier when dealing with events: EventTarget, EventListener, Event, DocumentEvent, MouseEvent, MutationEvent, etc. However, it does not include an interface for the keyboard events, which will be dealt with in later versions of the DOM.
Level of support: Very good. See our bugs in the Events specification.</p>
      <p>The DOM2 CSS, or DOM2 Style, allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content of style sheets. It has interfaces for Style Sheets, Cascading Style Sheets, CSSRule, CSSStyleDeclaration, the famous getComputedStyle (supported in Mozilla), the many many CSS2Properties, and all the media rules you can imagine.
Level of support: Good. See our bugs in the Style specification.</p>
      <p>The DOM2 Traversal and Range allow programs and scripts to dynamically traverse and identify a range of content in a document. The DOM2 Traversal provides interfaces like NodeIterator and TreeWalker to easily traverse the content of a document. The DOM2 Range allows the creation, insertion, modification, and deletion of a range of content in a Document, DocumentFragment, or Attr. It can be characterized as selecting all of the content between a pair of boundary-points.
Level of support: Good for Range; for Traversal, the TreeWalker is supported, and NodeIterator support was implemented in Firefox 3.5.</p>
      <p>The DOM2 HTML allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content and structure of HTML documents. It extends the interfaces defined in the DOM1 HTML, using the DOM2 Core possibilities. It introduces the contentDocument property, a useful way to access the document contained in a frame.</p>
      <h3>LEVEL 3</h3>
      <p>distributed in April 2004, included support for XPath and Keyboard even handling, and additional interface for serializing documents as XML.</p>
      <p>Inside this specification, the keywords must, must not, required, shall, shall not, should, should not, recommended, may, and optional are to be translated as depicted in [RFC2119].</p>
      <p>This specifiaction is to be comprehended with regards to the DOM Level 3 Core specification [DOM3 Core] and the general contemplations for DOM usage apply. For instance, treatment of namespace URIs is examined in XML Namespaces. A user agent is not required to fit in with the total of another specification so as to fit in with this specification, however it must adjust to the specific parts of some other specifications which are called out in this specification (e.g., an acclimating DOM3 Events user agent must bolster the DOMString information sort as characterized in Web IDL, yet require not bolster each technique or information sort characterized in Web IDL so as to fit in with DOM3 Events).</p>
      <p>This specification characterizes a few classes of conformance for various user agents, specifications, and content authors:</p>
      <p>Web browsers and other dynamic or interactive user agents</p>
      <p>A dynamic or intelligent user agents, alluded to here as a browser (be it a Web browser, AT (Accessibility Technology) application, or other similar program), complies with DOM Level 3 Events in the event that it underpins:</p>
      <p>the Core module characterized in [DOM3 Core]</p>
      <p>the Event dispatch and DOM occasion stream instrument</p>
      <p>every one of the interfaces and occasions with their related strategies, traits, and semantics characterized in this detail except for those set apart as censured (a conforming user agent may actualize the expostulated interfaces, occasions, or APIs for in reverse similarity, however is not required to do as such so as to accommodate)</p>
      <p>the entire arrangement of key and code values characterized in [DOM3 key Values] and [DOM3 code Values] (subject to stage accessibility), and</p>
      <p>all other standardizing prerequisites characterized in this determination.</p>
      <p>A conforming browser must dispatch occasions fitting to the given EventTarget when the conditions characterized for that occasion sort have been met.</p>
      <p>A browser adjusts particularly to DOM Level 3 Events on the off chance that it actualizes the interfaces and related occasion sorts determined in Event Types.</p>
      <p>A conforming browser must support scripting, decisive intelligence, or some different methods for recognizing and dispatching occasions in the way depicted by this determination, and must bolster the APIs indicated for that occasion sort.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding meeting all other conformance criteria, a conforming browser may actualize elements of this particular set apart as censured, for in reverse similarity with existing substance, however such execution is disheartened.</p>
      <p>A conforming browser may likewise bolster highlights not found in this particular, but rather which utilize the Event dispatch and DOM occasion stream component, interfaces, occasions, or different elements characterized in DOM Level 3 Events, and may execute extra interfaces and occasion sorts proper to that usage. Such elements can be later institutionalized in future determinations.</p>
      <p>A browser which does not fit in with every required bit of this particular must not assert conformance to DOM Level 3 Events. Such an execution which conforms to parts of this determination may guarantee conformance to those particular bits.</p>
      <p>An acclimating browser should likewise be a conforming execution of the IDL sections in this particular, as portrayed in the Web IDL determination [WEBIDL].</p>
      <p>Authoring tools</p>
      <p>A content authoring tool fits in with DOM Level 3 Events on the off chance that it produces content which utilizes the occasion sorts and Event dispatch and DOM occasion stream display, predictable in a way as characterized in this determination.</p>
      <p>A content authoring tool must not assert conformance to DOM Level 3 Events for substance it produces which utilizes components of this determination set apart as censured in this detail.</p>
      <p>An acclimating content authoring tool should give to the content author a way to utilize all occasion sorts and interfaces proper to all host dialects in the content document being delivered.</p>
      <p>Content author and content</p>
      <p>A content author makes adjusting DOM Level 3 Events content if that content utilizes the event types and Event dispatch and DOM occasion stream show, steady in a way as characterized in this specification.</p>
      <p>A content author ought not utilize components of this detail set apart as deplored, however ought to depend rather upon substitution instruments characterized in this specification and somewhere else.</p>
      <p>conforming content must utilize the semantics of the interfaces and event types as portrayed in this specification.</p>
      <p>Specification and host languages</p>
      <p>A specification or host languages fits in with DOM Level 3 Events on the off chance that it references and uses the Event dispatch and DOM occasion stream system, interfaces, occasions, or different components characterized in [DOM4], and does not develop these elements in contradictory ways.</p>
      <p>A specification or host language adjusts particularly to DOM Level 3 Events on the off chance that it references and uses the interfaces and related occasion sorts indicated in Event Types. An adjusting particular may characterize extra interfaces and occasion sorts fitting to that specification, or may augment the DOM Level 3 Events interfaces and occasion sorts in a way that does not repudiate or struggle with the meanings of those interfaces and occasion sorts in this specification.</p>
      <p>Particulars or host language which reference DOM Level 3 Events ought not utilize or suggest components of this specification set apart as censured, however ought to utilize or prescribe the showed trade for that the element (if accessible).</p>
      <p>Event articles are dispatched to an event target. Toward the start of the dispatch, executions should first decide the event objects's engendering way.</p>
      <p>The engendering way should be a requested rundown of current event targets through which the event object must pass. For DOM executions, the engendering way should mirror the various leveled tree structure of the archive. The last thing in the rundown must be the event target. The former things in the rundown are alluded to as the objective's predecessors, and the quickly going before thing as the objective's parent. Once decided, the proliferation way should not be changed. For DOM usage, this applies regardless of the possibility that a component in the proliferation way is moved inside the DOM or expelled from the DOM</p>
      <h3>LEVEL 4</h3>
      <p>DOM Level 4 was distributed in 2015. It is a depiction of the WHATWG expectation for everyday comforts</p>
      <p>This specification institutionalizes the DOM. It does as such as takes after:</p>
      <p>1. By solidifying DOM Level 3 Core [DOM3CORE], Element Traversal [ELEMENTTRAVERSAL], Selectors API Level 2 [SELECTORSAPI], the "DOM Event Architecture" and "Fundamental Event Interfaces" parts of UI Events [UIEVENTS] (particular sort of occasions don't have a place in the DOM Standard), and DOM Level 2 Traversal and Range [DOM2TR], and:</p>
      <p>Aligning them with the JavaScript biological community where conceivable.</p>
      <p>Aligning them with existing usage.</p>
      <p>Simplifying them however much as could reasonably be expected.</p>
      <p>2. By moving components from the HTML Standard [HTML] that ake more sense to be indicated as a major aspect of the DOM Standard.</p>
      <p>3. By characterizing a swap for the "Change Events" and "Transformation Name Event Types" parts of UI Events Specification (some time ago DOM Level 3 Events) [UIEVENTS] as the old model was dangerous.</p>
      <p>4. By characterizing new components that improve basic DOM operations.</p>
      <p>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this record are to be deciphered as depicted in RFC 2119. For lucidness, these words don't show up in every single capitalized letter in this detail. [RFC2119]</p>
      <p>Requirements expressed in the basic as a component of calculations, (for example, "strip any driving space characters" or "return false and end these means") are to be translated with the significance of the catchphrase ("must", "ought to", "may", and so forth.) utilized as a part of presenting the calculation.</p>
      <p>Conformance requirements stated as calculations or particular strides might be actualized in any way, inasmuch as the final product is proportional. (Specifically, the calculations characterized in this particular are planned to be anything but difficult to take after, and not proposed to be performant.)</p>
      <p>User Agents may force execution particular points of confinement on generally unconstrained sources of info, e.g. to forestall refusal of administration assaults, to make preparations for coming up short on memory, or to work around stage particular restrictions.</p>
      <p>At the point when a technique or an ascribe is said to call another strategy or quality, the User Agents must summon its inner API for that trait or technique so that e.g. the creator can't change the conduct by abrogating traits or strategies with custom properties or capacities in JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Unless generally expressed, string examinations are done for a case-sensitive way.</p>
      <p>The term context object implies the object on which the algorithm, quality getter, attribute setter, or method being discussed was called. At the point when the setting article is unambiguous, the term can be precluded.</p>
      <p>All through the web stage occasions are dispatched to articles to flag an event, for example, organize movement or client connection. These articles actualize the EventTarget interface and can in this way add occasion audience members to watch occasions by calling addEventListener():</p>
      <p>Occasion audience members can be evacuated by using the removeEventListener() technique, passing similar contentions.</p>
      <p>Occasions are objects as well and actualize the Event interface (or a determined interface). In the case above ev is the occasion. It is passed as contention to occasion audience's callback (regularly a JavaScript Function as appeared previously). Occasion audience members key off the occasion's sort trait esteem ("stack" in the above illustration). The occasion's objective quality esteem gives back the question which the occasion was dispatched (obj above).</p>
      <p>Presently while ordinarily occasions are dispatched by the client specialist as the consequence of client connection or the culmination of some undertaking, applications can dispatch occasions themselves, usually known as engineered occasions:</p>
      <p>Aside from flagging, occasions are once in a while likewise used to give an application a chance to control what occurs next in an operation. For example as a component of shape accommodation an occasion whose sort trait esteem is "submit" is dispatched. On the off chance that this present occasion's preventDefault() strategy is conjured, frame accommodation will be ended. Applications who wish to make utilization of this usefulness through occasions dispatched by the application (engineered occasions) can make utilization of the arrival estimation of the dispatchEvent() strategy:</p>
      <p>At the point when an occasion is dispatched to a question that takes an interest in a tree (e.g. a component), it can achieve occasion audience members on that object's precursors as well. To start with all object's predecessor occasion audience members whose catch variable is set to genuine are conjured, in tree arrange. Second, question's own particular occasion audience members are called. Lastly, and just if occasion's air pockets characteristic esteem is valid, question's precursor occasion audience members are called once more, yet now in turn around tree arrange.</p>
      <p>The troubleshoot capacity will be conjured twice. Each time the occasions' objective characteristic esteem will be the traverse component. The first run through currentTarget quality's esteem will be the archive, the second time the body component. eventPhase characteristic's esteem changes from CAPTURING_PHASE to BUBBLING_PHASE.
