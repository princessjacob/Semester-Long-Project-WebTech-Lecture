1. GET - requests data from a specified resource.

2. POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. This often causes a change in state or side effects on the server.

3. HEAD - Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body.

4. PUT - uploads a representation of the specified URI. It replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

5. DELETE - deletes the specified resource

6. OPTIONS - returns the HTTP methods that the server supports. This is used to describe communication options for the target resource.

7. CONNECT - converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel.

8. PATCH - this is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
