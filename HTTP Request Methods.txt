STANDARD METHODS
References: http://www.w3schools.com/Tags/ref_httpmethods.asp
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods, notes

1. GET - requests data from a specified resource.

2. POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. This often causes a change in state or side effects on the server.

3. HEAD - Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body.

4. PUT - uploads a representation of the specified URI. It replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

5. DELETE - deletes the specified resource

6. OPTIONS - returns the HTTP methods that the server supports. This is used to describe communication options for the target resource.

7. CONNECT - converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel.

8. PATCH - this is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

9. TRACE - request a loopback of the request message, request the server to echo back to the client the received request message.
- typically used for testing/diagnostics of the request/response chain

* Chunk Encoding - message is sent by chunks and measured by its length.
* content-length - identifies how large the file is; deals with what type the fata's file is

EXTEND METHODS
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV
i.e. WebDav
WebDav methods
1. PROPFIND – used to retrieve properties, stored as XML, from a web resource. It is also overloaded to allow one to retrieve the collection structure (also known as directory hierarchy) of a remote system.
2. PROPPATCH – used to change and delete multiple properties on a resource in a single atomic act
3. MKCOL – used to create collections (a.k.a. a directory)
4. COPY – used to copy a resource from one URI to another
5. MOVE – used to move a resource from one URI to another
6. LOCK – used to put a lock on a resource. WebDAV supports both shared and exclusive locks.
7. UNLOCK – used to remove a lock from a resource


OTHER METHODS
1. SAFE METHODS - these methods doesn't affect the resource. The only change to do is the log of the resource.
i.e. GET, HEAD, TRACE and OPTIONS

2. IDEMPOTENT METHODS - repeated execution should result to the same effect.
i.e. GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE

3. CACHEABLE METHODS - response to requests going to a cacheable
- cache: where you can store something or local storage.
