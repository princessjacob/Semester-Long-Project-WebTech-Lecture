      <h3>IOT</h3>
      <p>The Internet of Things or sometimes known as Internet of Everything (IoE) talks about how our devices connect with each other, this is called as machine-to-machine and also how our devices connects to the internet. IoT also uses cloud-based applications without it, it will not work. Cloud allows the apps to work for you 
    anytime and anywhere. The IoT or it is called as Internet of Things was invented in September 1985 by Peter T. Lewis at U.S Federal Communications Commission (FCC) supported session at the Congressional Black Caucus 15th Legislative Weekend.</p>

    <div id="protocols" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>PROTOCOLS</h3>
      <p>Protocols are communication language between network devices and it is sometimes indicates to as an access method.
TCP/IP or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is one common protocols used in Windows. It is a routable, 
non-proprietary protocol that‘s the predominant Windows network protocol. It‘s supported by all versions of Windows 
and most other non-Microsoft operating systems. TCP/IP is also the protocol of the Internet.The Internet protocol was 
from research and development in 1960's by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="ISP" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>ISP</h3>
      <p> ISP or Internet Service Provider is used by smaller companies and individuals that provide connectivity to the 
internet. The first ISP was introduced in 1974 by Telnet, the first commercial version of ARPANET 
(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). The first ISP's were established in 1989 in Australia and US.</p>
    </div> 
      <div id="interconnectionsfromcountrytocountry" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>INTERCONNECTIONS FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY</h3>
      <p> The satellite link internet connection to an ISP is now also available in rural areas where internet services 
are sometimes isn’t available or limited. The uplink connection from the LAN to the ISP is usually by a 
telephone line/modem connection and isn‘t as fast as the satellite downlink. The first installation on the 
first transatlantic telegraph cable was in 1854 that connected Newfoundland and Ireland. </p>
