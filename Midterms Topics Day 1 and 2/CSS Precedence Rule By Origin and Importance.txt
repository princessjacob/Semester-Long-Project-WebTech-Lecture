CSS Precedence Rule By Origin and Importance

By origin tells about the source of the declaration like the author styles, user styles, browser defaults.
They say that each style rule has an origin which means that it is where is enters the cascade. 

There are three core origins:
First is the Author. The author specifies the style sheets for the source document according to the conventions to the conventions of the document language. 
Second is the User. The user may be able to specify style information for a particular document. 
Third is the User Agent. It is conforming user agent must apply the default stylesheet. The default stylesheet of the user agent should contain the elements of the document language in the ways that satisfies the general presentation expectations for the document language. 
The CSS cascade assists the weight of each style rule. When there are several rules apply, the one with greatest weight takes the precedence. The rules in the author styles sheet has more weight than the rules in the user style sheet. 

Important Declarations
The !important annotation is to create a balance the power between author and the user style sheets. In order to balance it, the declaration to be made can be important which means it can increase its weight in the cascade and it is inverted to the order of precedence. Its declaration is important if there is an !important annotation in it.
