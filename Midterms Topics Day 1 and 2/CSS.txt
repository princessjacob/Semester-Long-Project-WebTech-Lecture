Types of Style Sheets
1.  Embedded style sheets - these are style sheets that are part of an HTML document, it is more useful when used in single web  pages.
2. External style sheets -the content of  external style sheet looks the same with embedded but they are not included in the HTML page, they are placed in a separate file with an extension file of ".css".
3. Inline style sheets - this style sheet is the same with embedded because they are placed inside the HTML document. It is easier to edit styles while using inline style because you can easily edit your style within the document.
